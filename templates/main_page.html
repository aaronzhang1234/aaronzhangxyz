  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <h2>Why I'm Majoring in Computer Science</h2>
  <p> I'm interested in all facets of Computer Science but the one area I'm extremely interested in is the area of computer security. With recent attacks like WannaCry, Mirai, and the increase of computer attacks with the same tune, we are living in a very vulnerable world and security has not advanced at the same pace as the attacks have. I personally want to make the world a more secure place, but find it increasingly hard due to the rise of IOT devices which seem to focus more on releasing and money than actual security and the privacy of the user.Because of this I feel like I can make a difference within the world of computer security even if that difference is just preparing SQL statements and hasing my passwords.</p>
  <h2>What Drives Me </h2>
  <p>Outside of computer security, what drives me to be the best in computer science and programming is the feeling of creation. Compared to other fields, computer science both has the feeling of learning and advancing along with the feeling actually accomplishing something that you can show off. Because of this, I do feel like I am contributing to the world, even this website can be seen worldwide and is a personal part of history that I can change. As I learn more, the more I realize that everything in this world is temporary and the only things we can do is build and learn.</p>
  <h2>Hobbies and Other Intrests</h2>
  <p>Other than computer science I am an avid student of history. I enjoy reading about the past as that is the only way we can predict the future. My main intrests in history are North Africa and the Ottoman Empire. I guess you can call me a budding historian because of this, but I do find great intrest in reading about cultures and histories much more different than mine. It helps you learn more about yourself and allows you to grow as a person.</p>
