2017/6/5 - First commit! Added Morse Messenger, went from sqlite to postgresql, added main page.
2017/6/7 - Second commit! Added twitter stuff and things to monitor tweets throughout the specified account. Also created tab for twitter analytics and can now create graphs and wordclouds based off those tweets gathered!
2017/6/12 - Third commit! Changed layout and structuring of the entirething
made create graph look much better
2017/6/12 - Fourth commit. Kinda useless adding stuff
2017/6/18 - Fifth commit. Removed twitter stuff because it wasn't working out. Useless program that took up too much space, removed projects as I can just put new tabs for them. Pruning for WikiEats later.
